# Mini-Traffic-Light-Arduino ðŸš¦

Mini Traffic Light is a simple yet effective project built using **Arduino Uno** to simulate a real-life traffic light system. This project is designed for beginners to understand the working of LEDs, resistors, and timing control using Arduino programming.

## âœ¨ Features
- **Traffic Light Simulation** â€“ Mimics the behavior of a standard traffic signal (Red, Yellow, Green).
- **Customizable Timing** â€“ Adjust the duration of each light phase easily in the code.
- **Compact & Educational** â€“ Perfect for learning about Arduino programming and basic electronics.
- **Low Power Consumption** â€“ Runs efficiently on minimal power.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- **Microcontroller:** Arduino Uno
- **Components:** LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green), Resistors, Jumper Wires
- **Programming Language:** C++ (Arduino Sketch)
- **Power Source:** USB Power Supply or Battery Pack
